Installation
============

If you have a working Python 3 environment, use pypi to install the latest the
package.

.. code-block::

    pip install https://github.com/uvchik/reegis_phd/archive/phd.zip


Some required packages need the installation of additional binary packages on
your operating system.

On a Linux Debian system you can use the following command to solve the
requirements beforehand.

.. code-block::

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev proj-bin libproj-dev libgeos-dev python3-tk libspatialindex-dev virtualenv


Basic usage
===========

Basically two scripts are provided: `phd_figures` and
`reproduce_phd_optimisation`. With `phd_figures` it is possible to plot all
figures that are based on results. For all other figures the source code of the
image (svg or graphml) is downloaded.

For all 6.x figures the results of the scenarios are needed. To create these
results the `reproduce_phd_optimisation` script can be used.

phd_figures
+++++++++++

.. NOTE::

    The plot of some figures may take some minutes up to hours on the
    **first run**, because the needed data is calculated in the background. The
    data is stored on your hard drive to speed up the following plots.

    The most time-consuming step is the calculation of feed-in time series.

Pass the number of the figure to plot and store it. If no path is given the
default path is ``$HOME/reegis``.

To plot e.g. figure 3.5 use the following command:

.. code-block::

    phd_figures 3.5

To define a directory for the stored figures a path can be passed:

.. code-block::

    phd_figures 3.5 /home/username/my_figures

It is also possible to create all figures of the work and store it to a given
directory. This may take some time especially on the first run (see above).

.. code-block::

    phd_figures all /home/username/my_figures


reproduce_phd_optimisation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To solve large scenarios a RAM of up to 24 GB is necessary. The script uses
parallelisation and you have pass the fraction (0 to 1) of the cores to be
used for the optimisation. Be aware that the scenarios need up to 24 GB of
RAM so that two large parallel scenarios may need 48 GB and so on. To use one
core on a PC just pass a small number:

.. code-block::

    reproduce_phd_optimisation 0.01

The default path is ``$HOME/reegis``, to use a different path type:

.. code-block::

    reproduce_phd_optimisation 0.01 /your/path/for/the/results
